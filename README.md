Upstart & Freebase College Reconciliation
=========================================

Goal:

###Notes:
* 
* Input file contains "--" when appending city or campus name to university name ("University of State--Campus"). The college name in the Freebase result usually appears as "University of State Campus", "University of State, Campus" or "University of State at Campus".
* Initially the Reconciliation endpoint of the Freebase API was considered for use to target those that could not be found via Search. However, results were not produced.
* Instead, variations of the college name were needed for Freebase to find the correct Freebase ID.
